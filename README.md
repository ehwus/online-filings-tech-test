# Tech Test for Online Filings

## Brief

The goal of this exercise is to show your understanding of:

- basic coding principles
- json data structures
- javascript/nodeJS syntax
- using new API (puppeteer)
- reading technical documentation and find solutions on your own

You have 48 hours after receiving this test by email to send it back.
Please note that we will only be able to consider your submission if the code runs and is in a working state.
You are allowed (and encouraged) to search for documentation, tutorials, how-tos... online,
BUT **you have to do the exercise by yourself**.
You will be asked to explain your code during the following interview.

TODO:
[ ] The file test.json in this folder defines a list of actions to execute.
[ ] Each action in the JSON maps to a function in the main.js module, with its respective arguments.
[ ] Your job is to fill in the blanks in the main.js module to parse and execute the
actions defined in the file test.json
[ ] You must make the functions listed in the main.js file work in order to make the tests pass in the main.test.js file (but do not edit main.test.js!).
[ ] You can check your progress throughout the challenge and ensure you're on the right track by seeing how many tests are passing: to do so, run the command npm test.
